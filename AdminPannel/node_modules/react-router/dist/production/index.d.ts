 * It's often better to use {@link redirect} in [`action`](../../start/framework/route-module#action)/[`loader`](../../start/framework/route-module#loader)

 *
 * The returned function signature is `navigate(to, options?)`/`navigate(delta)` where:

 * * `options` contains options for modifying the navigation
 *   * `flushSync`: Wrap the DOM updates in [`ReactDom.flushSync`](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/flushSync)
 *   * `preventScrollReset`: Do not scroll back to the top of the page after navigation
 *   * `relative`: `"route"` or `"path"` to control relative routing logic
 *   * `replace`: Replace the current entry in the [`History`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History) stack
 *   * `state`: Optional [`history.state`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History/state) to include with the new {@link Location}
 *   * `viewTransition`: Enable [`document.startViewTransition`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/startViewTransition) for this navigation

 *     <button onClick={() => navigate(-1)}>
 *       Go Back

 *   );
 * }
 *
 * @additionalExamples
 * ### Navigate to another path
 *
 * ```tsx
 * navigate("/some/route");
 * navigate("/some/route?search=param");
 * ```
 *
 * ### Navigate with a {@link To} object
 *
 * All properties are optional.
 *
 * ```tsx
 * navigate({
 *   pathname: "/some/route",
 *   search: "?search=param",
 *   hash: "#hash",
 *   state: { some: "state" },
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * If you use `state`, that will be available on the {@link Location} object on
 * the next page. Access it with `useLocation().state` (see {@link useLocation}).
 *
 * ### Navigate back or forward in the history stack
 *
 * ```tsx
 * // back
 * // often used to close modals
 * navigate(-1);
 *
 * // forward
 * // often used in a multistep wizard workflows
 * navigate(1);
 * ```
 *
 * Be cautious with `navigate(number)`. If your application can load up to a
 * route that has a button that tries to navigate forward/back, there may not be
 * a `[`History`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History)
 * entry to go back or forward to, or it can go somewhere you don't expect
 * (like a different domain).
 *
 * Only use this if you're sure they will have an entry in the [`History`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History)
 * stack to navigate to.
 *
 * ### Replace the current entry in the history stack
 *
 * This will remove the current entry in the [`History`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History)
 * stack, replacing it with a new one, similar to a server side redirect.
 *
 * ```tsx
 * navigate("/some/route", { replace: true });
 * ```
 *
 * ### Prevent Scroll Reset
 *
 * [MODES: framework, data]
 *
 * <br/>
 * <br/>
 *
 * To prevent {@link ScrollRestoration | `<ScrollRestoration>`} from resetting
 * the scroll position, use the `preventScrollReset` option.
 *
 * ```tsx
 * navigate("?some-tab=1", { preventScrollReset: true });
 * ```
 *
 * For example, if you have a tab interface connected to search params in the
 * middle of a page, and you don't want it to scroll to the top when a tab is
 * clicked.
 *
 * ### Return Type Augmentation
 *
 * Internally, `useNavigate` uses a separate implementation when you are in
 * Declarative mode versus Data/Framework mode - the primary difference being
 * that the latter is able to return a stable reference that does not change
 * identity across navigations. The implementation in Data/Framework mode also
 * returns a [`Promise`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)
 * that resolves when the navigation is completed. This means the return type of
 * `useNavigate` is `void | Promise<void>`. This is accurate, but can lead to
 * some red squigglies based on the union in the return value:
 *
 * - If you're using `typescript-eslint`, you may see errors from
 *   [`@typescript-eslint/no-floating-promises`](https://typescript-eslint.io/rules/no-floating-promises)
 * - In Framework/Data mode, `React.use(navigate())` will show a false-positive
 *   `Argument of type 'void | Promise<void>' is not assignable to parameter of
 *   type 'Usable<void>'` error
 *
 * The easiest way to work around these issues is to augment the type based on the
 * router you're using:
 *
 * ```ts
 * // If using <BrowserRouter>
 * declare module "react-router" {
 *   interface NavigateFunction {
 *     (to: To, options?: NavigateOptions): void;
 *     (delta: number): void;
 *   }
 * }
 *
 * // If using <RouterProvider> or Framework mode
 * declare module "react-router" {
 *   interface NavigateFunction {
 *     (to: To, options?: NavigateOptions): Promise<void>;
 *     (delta: number): Promise<void>;
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * @public
 * @category Hooks
 * @returns A navigate function for programmatic navigation
 */
declare function useNavigate(): NavigateFunction;
/**
 * Returns the parent route {@link Outlet | `<Outlet context>`}.
 *
 * Often parent routes manage state or other values you want shared with child
 * routes. You can create your own [context provider](https://react.dev/learn/passing-data-deeply-with-context)
 * if you like, but this is such a common situation that it's built-into
 * {@link Outlet | `<Outlet>`}.
 *
 * ```tsx
 * // Parent route
 * function Parent() {
 *   const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0);
 *   return <Outlet context={[count, setCount]} />;
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * ```tsx
 * // Child route
 * import { useOutletContext } from "react-router";
 *
 * function Child() {
 *   const [count, setCount] = useOutletContext();
 *   const increment = () => setCount((c) => c + 1);
 *   return <button onClick={increment}>{count}</button>;
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * If you're using TypeScript, we recommend the parent component provide a
 * custom hook for accessing the context value. This makes it easier for
 * consumers to get nice typings, control consumers, and know who's consuming
 * the context value.
 *
 * Here's a more realistic example:
 *
 * ```tsx filename=src/routes/dashboard.tsx lines=[14,20]
 * import { useState } from "react";
 * import { Outlet, useOutletContext } from "react-router";
 *
 * import type { User } from "./types";

 * type ContextType = { user: User | null };
 *
 * export default function Dashboard() {
 *   const [user, setUser] = useState<User | null>(null);
 *
 *   return (
 *     <div>
 *       <h1>Dashboard</h1>
 *       <Outlet context={{ user } satisfies ContextType} />
 *     </div>
 *   );
 * }
 *
 * export function useUser() {
 *   return useOutletContext<ContextType>();
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * ```tsx filename=src/routes/dashboard/messages.tsx lines=[1,4]
 * import { useUser } from "../dashboard";
 *
 * export default function DashboardMessages() {

 *   return (

/**
 * Returns an object of key/value-pairs of the dynamic params from the current
 * URL that were matched by the routes. Child routes inherit all params from

 *
 * Assuming a route pattern like `/posts/:postId` is matched by `/posts/123`
 * then `params.postId` will be `"123"`.
 *
 * @example
 * import { useParams } from "react-router";
 *
 * function SomeComponent() {
 *   let params = useParams();
 *   params.postId;
 * }
 *
 * @additionalExamples
 * ### Basic Usage
 *
 * ```tsx
 * import { useParams } from "react-router";
 *
 * // given a route like:
 * <Route path="/posts/:postId" element={<Post />} />;
 *
 * // or a data route like:
 * createBrowserRouter([
 *   {
 *     path: "/posts/:postId",
 *     component: Post,
 *   },
 * ]);
 *
 * // or in routes.ts
 * route("/posts/:postId", "routes/post.tsx");
 * ```
 *
 * Access the params in a component:
 *
 * ```tsx
 * import { useParams } from "react-router";
 *
 * export default function Post() {
 *   let params = useParams();
 *   return <h1>Post: {params.postId}</h1>;
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * ### Multiple Params
 *
 * Patterns can have multiple params:
 *
 * ```tsx
 * "/posts/:postId/comments/:commentId";
 * ```
 *
 * All will be available in the params object:
 *
 * ```tsx
 * import { useParams } from "react-router";
 *
 * export default function Post() {
 *   let params = useParams();
 *   return (
 *     <h1>
 *       Post: {params.postId}, Comment: {params.commentId}
 *     </h1>
 *   );
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * ### Catchall Params
 *
 * Catchall params are defined with `*`:
 *
 * ```tsx
 * "/files/*";
 * ```
 *
 * The matched value will be available in the params object as follows:
 *
 * ```tsx
 * import { useParams } from "react-router";
 *
 * export default function File() {
 *   let params = useParams();
 *   let catchall = params["*"];
 *   // ...
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * You can destructure the catchall param:
 *
 * ```tsx
 * export default function File() {
 *   let { "*": catchall } = useParams();
 *   console.log(catchall);
 * }
 * ```

A progressively enhanced HTML [`<form>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/form) that submits data to actions via `fetch`, activating pending states in `useNavigation` which enables advanced user interfaces beyond a basic HTML form. After a form's action completes, all data on the page is automatically revalidated to keep the UI in sync with the data.

Because it uses the HTML form API, server rendered pages are interactive at a basic level before JavaScript loads. Instead of React Router managing the submission, the browser manages the submission as well as the pending states (like the spinning favicon). After JavaScript loads, React Router takes over enabling web application user experiences.

Form is most useful for submissions that should also change the URL or otherwise add an entry to the browser history stack. For forms that shouldn't manipulate the browser history stack, use [`<fetcher.Form>`][fetcher_form].
